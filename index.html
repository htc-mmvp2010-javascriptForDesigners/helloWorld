<p>My name is Anthony Emmons. All my childhood influences are getting old, which means I must be getting old?! Tom Cruise is still my favorite actor. I don't care if he jumps on couches. At 53, he is still more athletic than I am. How does that work? Hanging off of a plane FOR REAL in MI5?? Yeah, as if I would ever do that!? Whatever, I forked this project. I am a superstar!!</p>
